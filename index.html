            <h1>Loan Management System Model</h1>
            <p>The Loan Management System Model automates the entire loan lifecycle, from application to approval, disbursement, and repayment tracking. It uses machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost for credit scoring, default prediction, and fraud prevention. The system integrates with payment gateways for seamless disbursement and real-time tracking of repayments. It includes risk assessment tools for managing high-risk loans and optimizing the loan portfolio. Built with Django, PostgreSQL, React.js, and Next.js, it offers an intuitive client portal and administrative dashboard. The system ensures compliance with regulations, utilizes secure architecture with Docker and Kubernetes, and enhances communication through automated notifications and alerts.</p>

            <h1>IFRS 9 Model </h1>
            <p>The IFRS 9 Model I designed was to comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, focusing on financial instruments, including loan impairments, and helps organizations manage credit risk. It includes the calculation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) for loans and other financial assets based on forward-looking information. The model uses historical data, macroeconomic factors, and a variety of assumptions to predict the likelihood of default over different time horizons (12-month or lifetime). It integrates machine learning algorithms to improve credit scoring accuracy and assess the risk of default.Tools used in the development include Python for machine learning, SQL for data management, and Excel for financial calculations and reporting.</p>
